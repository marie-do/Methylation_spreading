# Methylation_spreading
Investigating the genetic features that influence the DNA methylation spreading after TE insertion would be a means to predict deleterious methylation and to better understand the mechanisms by which TEs contribute to both genome regulation and instability.
This work aims to apply machine learning methods to investigate the relationship between genetic features associated to TE insertion and the spreading of methylation. This work follows a four-part investigation:

1- Conducted an initial comparison of multiple machine learning algorithms to identify the most suitable modeling approach.
2- Performed both regression and classification analyses using Random Forest models, and systematically compared their performance.
3- Assessed feature importance through multiple methods (impurity-based, permutation, and SHAP) to identify the most predictive genomic and epigenetic variables.
4- Investigated methylation spreading patterns in TEs and their flanking regions.
